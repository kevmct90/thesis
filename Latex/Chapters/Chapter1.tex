This chapter introduces my research topic, the predictiveness of location-based features in SME credit scoring, and how it can potentially can be used to improve credit scoring in financial institutions. The motivation for the research question are discussed with details of its significance. The aims of the thesis along with the research objectives and analytical approach are then stated. The scope and limitation of this research are then described. The chapter concludes with a summary and outlines of this thesis.

\section{Background of the Problem}

We begin with a high-level overview of SME credit scoring and location data in machine learning.

\subsection{SME Credit Scoring}

Credit scoring, in layman's language is the name given to describe the process of assessing how risky customers and applicants are to default on their financial obligation \citep{hand_statistical_1997}. The goal is to split customers into two classes, 'good' and 'bad'. Customers in the good class are considered likely to repay on their financial obligation while customers in the bad class are likely to default on theirs. In order to make this decision about its customers, financial institutions use information known about the customer and other relevant metrics to identify the customers riskiness. 


Since the financial crisis of 2007-2008 there has been a a much greater emphasis on credit scoring in the consumer lending process in banking. One of the most common methods of building scorecards is by using data mining \citep{baesens_50_2009}. One of the benefits to improving the scoring accuracy of a credit model is obviously the significant future savings \citep{west 2000} but also financial institutions are under increasing pressures from global (Bank for International Settlements) e.g. The European Central Bank and national bank e.g. Central bank of Ireland. Since the crisis these regulators police that financial institutions keep better care of their credit scoring systems. Poor performing credit systems can have massive adverse affects financially, reputation and supporting the economy.
\\\\
There are three main stages of a typical credit scorecard development \cite{van_gestel_credit_2009}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Dataset Construction
	\item Modelling
	\item Documentation 
\end{itemize}

This can dispalyed using this archtectural diagram. Insert find diagram.
\\\\
Each stage of this process cannot be left out when completing a industry credit scorecard, however for this research I will be focus particularly on the data contruction and modelling stages. The documentation stage is critcal for deployment of an industry scorecard but will not be investigated further in this thesis.

\section{Motivation}
The banking crisis of 2007-2008 
Since the financial of 2007-2008 there is an even greater emphasis on quality credit scoring. In Ireland it was the property bubble that collapsed causing the banking crisis. 

"Many believe that focusing on lending on the SME sector could play an important role in restoring faith in the banking system and supporting economic growth, according to leading experts"


The primary aim of this research project is to build a quantitative credit scorecard that will identify Small Medium Enterprise (SME) customers who are likely to go into arrears/defaults.


The upheaval in the financial markets that accompanied the 2007-2008 sub-prime
mortgage crisis has emphasised the large proportion of the banking industry based
on consumer lending (Thomas, 2009b). Credit scoring is an important part of the
consumer lending process. It is an endeavour regarded as one of the most popular
application fields for both data mining and operational research techniques (Baesens
et al., 2009). Improving the scoring accuracy of the credit decision by as much as
a fraction of a percent can result in significant future savings (West, 2000). Furthermore,
global (Bank for International Settlements) and national (central banks)
regulators insist that financial institutions keep better track of their credit scoring
systems. The costs of incorrectly classifying a customer can be high, both financially
and in terms of reputation.

\section{Research Project}
The research projects aims to build a SME credit scorecard, combine a base model in \subjectname\ combined with features based on SME locations. The aim of this scorecard is to identify SME customers who are likely to default and aim would be use these features in a scorecard in \subjectname.

\section{Research Objectives}
The primary goals of this research is to investigate if location based metrics are indicative to whether a SME customer is likely to default on their financial obligation or not. The credit score model built will make use of a historic credit score model in \subjectname\ and this will be combined with location based metrics in an attempt to improve the scorecard. 
 
The objectives of this research are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item To study the relevant state-of-the-art literature and industry best practices on building credit scorecards.
	\item Create a search address engine and for mapping customer addresses to locations in an address database.
	\item Create location based metrics using internal data from \subjectname\ such transactional, arrears ratio, post code and open data from the CSO.
	\item Identify most predictable features using feature reduction techniques.
	\item Build base model/scorecard to compare my research and experiment with.
	\item Build scorecard including location based metrics and evaluate results
	\item Assess is it possible to deploy the scorecard in \subjectname\ on out of time data.
	\item Assess whether the experiment was a success or failure.
	\item Determine what future research could be undertaken in the area to expand on the project.
\end{itemize}

\section{Research Methodology \& Analytical Approach}
The research methodology to be utilised here is empirical evaluation which will involve performing experimentation on a recorded history of user interactions on AIB's website. Appropriate evaluation methodologies will be used to determine the success of these experiments. Suitable techniques will also be used to measure, compare and analyse the performance by means of statistical methods, but also practical considerations related to the complexity of the technique being evaluated.

\section{Scope and Limitations}
The project will focus on building an SME credit scorecard, subset of the customers in \subjectname. A holdout dataset will be taken to build the model which will be predicting 12 months in advance.
\\\\
The data used in this project will be taken from the transaction visa debit table, in an ideal world for this analysis you get the location of the actual transactions taking place but this was not available so I had to roll it back to the customers address. Diagram possibly
