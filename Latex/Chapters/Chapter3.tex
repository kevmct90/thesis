This chapter will detail the design of the experiments that are to be implemented as part of the research project. It will detail how customers addresses are mapped to locations and how features are generated for these locations. It will also discuss any of the pre-processing, and feature selection and statistical techniques used to create select the data for the ABT.

The SME default problem would be considered imbalanced dataset for classification problem where algorithms make the assumption there is a equal number of good and bad classes/group \citep{japkowicz_class_2000}. The dataset used in this experiment has a small number of SME customer in default, because of this issue a number of approaches will taken to considered to address.

Statistical analysis and evaluation methods used to assess the strength of models will be detailed and discussed, also it will outline any further transformations necessary for specific algorithms. Finally criteria for deciding which model will be chosen as the best and most fit for purpose will be detailed.

\section{Data for Research and Data Preparation}
This research project will combine data from an existing scorecard in \subjectname\ with location based data. There will be three new sources of location based data for this experiment. They are as follows......

\subsection{Existing Data in \subjectname's Model}

\subsection{Electoral Division and Local Authority Classification}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \subjectname's Customers Transactional behaviour by location.
	\item \subjectname\ default ratio by location.
	\item CSO metrics captured using the 2011 census. 
\end{itemize}

Locations for this research will be found using \subjectname's customer addresses. These will be cleansed to be standardised them and will put through a search engine built using Solr. The top 10 results are returned using Solr, a matching algorithms are then ran to compare the searched address and returned results. The two distance formulas used to compare the are the following \textit{Levenshtein distance} and the \textit{Jaro-Winkler distance}.

\subsubsection{Levenshtein Distance}
Mathematically, the Levenshtein distance between two strings \textit{a}, \textit{b} (of length \text{\textbar}a\text{\textbar} and \text{\textbar}b\text{\textbar} respectively) is given by lev$_{a,b}$ (\text{\textbar}a\text{\textbar},\text{\textbar}b\text{\textbar}) where
\begin{align}
	lev_{a,b}(i,j) = 
	\begin{cases}
		\max(i,j) & \text{ if} \min(i,j)=0, \\
		\min \begin{cases}
			\operatorname{lev}_{a,b}(i-1,j) + 1 \\
			\operatorname{lev}_{a,b}(i,j-1) + 1 \\
			\operatorname{lev}_{a,b}(i-1,j-1) + 1_{(a_i \neq b_j)}
		\end{cases} & \text{ otherwise.}
	\end{cases}
\end{align}
where $1_{(a_i \neq b_j)}$ is the indicator function equal to $0$ when $a_i = b_j$ and equal to 1 otherwise, and $\operatorname{lev}_{a,b}(i,j)$ is the distance between the first $i$ characters of $a$ and the first $j$ characters of $b$.

\subsubsection{Jaro-Winkler Distance}
The Jaro distance $d_j$ of two given strings $s_1$ and $s_2$ is
 
\begin{align}
 d_j =\begin{cases}
 \begin{array}{l l}
 	0 & \text{if }m = 0\\
 	\frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{m}{|s_1|} + \frac{m}{|s_2|} + \frac{m-t}{m}\right) & \text{otherwise} \end{array} \end{cases}
\end{align}

Where: 
\vspace{-7mm} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item $m$ is the number of matching characters 
 	\item $t$ is half the number of transpositions
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Examples}
Give example of how addresses are cleansed, standardised, searched and results are calculated.

\subsection{Electoral Division and Local Authority}
\textbf{Local Authorities}
In census reports the country is divided into 29 counties/administrative counties and the five Cities which represent the
local authority areas. Outside Dublin there are 26 administrative counties (North Tipperary and South Tipperary each
ranks as a separate county for administrative purposes) and four Cities, i.e. Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway. In
Dublin the four local authority areas are identified separately, i.e. Dublin City and the three administrative counties of
Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin.

\textbf{Electoral Divisions}
There are 3,440 Electoral Divisions (EDs) which are the smallest legally defined administrative areas in the State. One ED, St. Mary's, straddles the Louth-Meath county border, and is presented in two parts in the SAPS1 tables, with one part in Louth and the other in Meath. There are 32 EDs with low population, which for reasons of confidentiality have been amalgamated into neighbouring EDs giving a total of 3,409 EDs which appear in the SAPS tables.

\subsection{Census 2011 Ireland}
The Census gives a comprehensive picture of the social and living conditions of the population in 2011. It provides detail to the smallest area and the results are an essential tool for effective policy, planning and decision making purposes. 

The data is organised around a number of themes (see below) and broken down by a range of geographic areas as
described below.

\subsection{Generating the ABTs}
We now have a reference list that allows us to apply a rank to all achievable loan application events prior to completion. A method is required to join this reference list with our csv (comma seperated value) log files resulting from the MapReduce job.

\subsection{Software Used}\label{softwareUsed}

\subsubsection{Address Matching}
A combination of Apache Solr\footnote{\url{http://lucene.apache.org/solr/}} and Python\footnote{\url{https://www.python.org/}} were used to match \subjectname's addresses to an ED/LA in GDD. Solr ia an open source web application enterprise search engine. It is an open source application written in Java, which is a wrapper around the Apache Lucence \footnote{{\url{https://lucene.apache.org/core/}}}. Combined they provide a reliable, fast, scalable platform capable of providing distributed indexing which can then be used for searching or navigation. Solr was used to index GD which then allowed it to be searched. Python is a high-level, general purpose programming language which can be used to build both large and small scale programs. Python like Solr is open source and freely available. One its most attractive and best characteristics is it is easy to read and use. A program was created to standardise and cleanse the addresses in \subjectname's database. The program would then take the cleansed addresses and query them against GDD indexed through the Solr web API, using string comparison algorithms discussed in Chapter 2 to return the most likely GDD address.

\subsubsection{Data Wrangling}
Anecdotally speaking, data scientists and analysts spend majority of their time data wrangling. Data wrangling is time consuming mundane process used to collect and prepare data prior to being explored for useful information. In the experiment of this thesis a variety of data types and data sources were used. Data from the \subjectname\ EDW, GDD in Solr served in JSON, CSO data in flat file to name a few. R\footnote{{\url{https://www.r-project.org/}}}, another open source programming language but has much more emphasis on statistical computing. It also has many libraries available for processing and data manipulation which are available in the CRAN\footnote{{\url{https://cran.r-project.org/}}} repository. The most useful package used during this process was \textit{reshape}\footnote{{\url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape/index.html}}}. Reshape allows to easily restructure, transpose and aggregate your data. 

\subsubsection{Visualisations}
R is also a very strong programming language at creating beautiful visualisations so it will be used throughout this paper. One package used in this paper was \textit{ggplot}
\footnote{{\url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html}}}. 

Some other custom geospatial visualisations may also be required. This could be done using Arcgis, Qgis, D3 or R still to be decided.

\subsubsection{Modelling}
SQL was used to identify customers to be used for predictions and generate the target class.
The models and experiments performed in this used in this are built in R and SAS. SAS is a proprietary software. SAS is the tool of choice by the modelling teams in \subjectname. Anecdotally SAS is a legacy in financial institutions, it is what people are used to using but also there is a for-profit corporation vetting the code for its customers and customer service and support corporations are used to. SAS offers a graphical interfaces which means users do not have to enter code, but this can be complemented using the SAS programming language. Anecdotally speaking SAS is excellent for building predictive modes resulting in good time to value. SAS Enterprise Miner includes the following components Time Series, Variable Clustering, Cluster, Interactive Binning, Principal Components, AutoNeural, DMNeural, DMine Regression, Gradient Boosting, Ensemble, and Text Mining.

R is a very strong competitor to SAS in this space. Because of its open source nature there are many libraries available for building predictive models. For example one popular package \textit{caret}\footnote{{\url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caret/index.html}}} contains many models and continues to grow

\section{Building Models}
In order to avoid over-fitting models, considerations need to be made as to what data to use in training the model. Each of the models built will be trained using a training set which is a subset of the over all available samples. We discussed possible options for training set selection in subsection


\section{Evaluation Methods}
Several evaluation techniques will be applied to quantify the usefulness of all models produced. As discussed in section \ref{modelEval}, there are various ways to evaluate the performance of a classifier. A common metric used is overall accuracy (\% of records correctly classified). 


\section{Conclusions}\label{desConc}
This chapter has discussed the processes required to carry out data mining techniques on non-relational web log data. The required data transformations have been discussed as well as the implemented methods for feature generation.
