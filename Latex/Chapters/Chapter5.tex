\section{Introduction}
This chapter concludes the dissertation, and will summarise the key findings from the research. A reminder of the research questions and objectives is given along with discussion on the contributions to the body of knowledge.
An evaluation of the experiment along with an evaluation of the overall research will be presented along with observed limitations. Ideas and areas of interest for future work and research will be highlighted followed by the concluding remarks.

\section{Problem Definition \& Research Overview}
The research carried out as part of this dissertation involved reviewing state of the art analytical practices in the field of web data mining and two-class classification with a view to understanding the potential in clicksteam data for predicting users likely to drop out of an application process. This research was used to design and implement experiments and build models capable of detecting users in difficulty.
