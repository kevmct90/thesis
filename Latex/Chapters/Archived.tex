We can see above in Fig. \ref{fig:Delinq_Model_Lift} that the majority of the models are returning positive results in the unseen test chart. This is very encouraging, for example if we were to contact 10\% of customers that these models decided were going to go into default, you would contact over twice as many customers that would go into default than if you used no model at all. This is very important when deciding on a business strategy and is where BE becomes extremely important.

\end{figure}

As with the lift chart in the Previous Delinquency model we can see in Fig. \ref{fig:NonDelinq_Model_Lift} the majority of the models are returning positive results most notably in the the regression validation and test result as you would expect. We are seeing a larger lift than in the Previous Delinquency model also. We can see for the regression model if we were to contact 10\% of the customers that this model decided were to going to go into default we would contact three times as many customers than you if you didn't use a model at all and choose them at random.
